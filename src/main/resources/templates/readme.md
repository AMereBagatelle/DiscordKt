DiscordKt is a framework for creating Discord bots entirely in Kotlin.
It uses Kord for direct interactions with the Discord API.

Documentation for this project is currently incomplete. 
Nearly all functions and fields within the codebase use KDocs/Javadocs for IDE discovery.
There is also an [example project](https://github.com/JakeJMattson/DiscordKtExample) that can be used as a reference for each version.
